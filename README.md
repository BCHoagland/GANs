## Types
- [x] GAN
- [ ] Wasserstein GAN (WGAN)
- [ ] Conditional GAN (cGAN)
- [ ] InfoGAN

## Dependencies
PyTorch, Numpy, Visdom

Training can be started simply by navigating to a folder and running `python train.py`.

A visdom server must be running locally prior to starting training. Run `visdom` command in a separate terminal window to do so.
